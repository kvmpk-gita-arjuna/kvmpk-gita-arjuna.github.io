Hi, I'm Harini. Currently, I am a PhD student in computer science at MIT, where I am part of the [Clinical and Applied Machine Learning Group](https://ddig.csail.mit.edu/), the [Visualization Group](http://vis.csail.mit.edu/), and the [Data + Feminism Lab](https://dataplusfeminism.mit.edu/). 

My research is at the intersection of machine learning (ML) and human-computer interaction (HCI). I'm interested in making ML systems more *grounded in context*. In my current work, this takes a lot of forms: for example, [co-designing](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3531146.3533132) context-specific datasets and models for counterdata collection, or developing [tools](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3490099.3511160) and [theory](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3411764.3445088) for communicating the limitations of ML systems to the people who use them and are affected by them.    

Before this, I did my undergrad and M.Eng. at MIT as well, working on [ML for healthcare](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v68/suresh17a/suresh17a.pdf). During my PhD, I've spent a couple summers interning at Google Brain, where I worked on [studying biases](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.03395.pdf) in word embedding models and building interactive [visualizations](https://github.com/PAIR-code/book-viz) of books with sentence embeddings. I also love traveling, reading, cooking and baking, and doing aerial arts. (This website template is forked from [this repo](https://github.com/ankitsultana/researcher).)
