Hello there! I am Mallikarjuna, my friends and colleagues call me as Arjun. I'm currently a Graduate Researcher at [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/).
Prior to that I worked with Professor Sumeet Kumar as a full-time Research Assistant at [Indian School of Business](https://www.isb.edu/en.html) over 3.9 years. I have three published papers in top conferences ACL, ASONAM and INFORMS on Data Science. One of my journal papers (Quantifying the Educational Quality of Kids’ Videos using Machine Comprehension) is in the final stage of revision at INFORMS Journal on Computing. Another paper (Large Language Models for Rating the Language of Children’s Videos on YouTube) is also planning . Also, I submitted a paper titled Gender Biases and Stereotyping in Children’s Videos: A Study on 100 Popular Kids Channels on YouTube to the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). This paper cleared the initial desk-reject phase (46% of the submitted manuscripts fail to clear this stage). Although we received positive reviews, the paper could not clear the final phase. We are now planning to submit this paper to Nature Human Behaviour (impact factor: 23.8).
Before joining at ISB, I worked at [Spacept](https://spacept.com/), [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/), [Indian Institue of Management Bangalore](https://www.iimb.ac.in/home) and I have finished my bachelors from [R.V.R. & J.C. College of Engineering](https://rvrjcce.ac.in/) in Computer Science and Engineering.

My research interests include Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Computational Neuroscience, Building bio-inspired models using brain inspired models, NLP, and Generative Models, also I have minor interests in Cognitive Sciences. Currently, I am working with [Prof. Ashique KhudaBukhsh](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~akhudabu/) and [Prof. Sumeet Kumar](https://sumeetkumar.in/) on projects related to AI for Social Good. If you are looking for mentorship to pursue a career in AI feel free to email happy to help :)

Apart from my work I like to spend time with my friends, creating new jokes, and I love to write poems, and letters :)

This quote from the Bhagavad Gita, **KARMANYE VADHIKARASTE MA PHALESHU KADACHANA**, is one that I wholeheartedly believe in and try to live by.
